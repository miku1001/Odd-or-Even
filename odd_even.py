# Write a Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers.
# The program will create two other text file; the first text file will be named even.txt that will contains all even numbers
# extracted from the numbers.txt. The second text file will be named odd.txt that will contains all odd numbers extracted from 
# the numbers.txt.

# open integers.txt(read), odd(append), even(append)
# read integers.txt line by line
# remove newline character and convert strings to integers
# if even,
# write to even.txt
# if odd,
# write to odd.txt
# start
